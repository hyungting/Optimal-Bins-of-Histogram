# Optimal-Bins-of-Histogram

## Introduction
This code is based on the research of Kevin H. Knuth. The main purpose of this code is to find the optimal number of bins for histograms based on statistic features of data.

## Instructions
Parameter **target** is the data whose optimal number of bins are yet to be found.
Parameter **maxBins** is the maximum number of bins of target.
